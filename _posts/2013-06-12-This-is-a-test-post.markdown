#Hello This is Brandon
##I have a new Jekyll site, and I'm learning the ropes.

What's the _point_?  Philosophical ramblings, wilderness survival training, knife making?  Who knows, perhaps all of the above.

Here's a table of things I do:

Life | Work 
 --- | --- 
 Make Beer | Write Code
 Make Knives | Run Automations 
 Make Web Apps | Attend Meetings 
 Ramble in the Woods | Avoid Attending Meetings

That about sums me up.  This post will be deleted.
